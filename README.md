# ScaredyCat
## Overview
ScaredyCat is a quick reaction iOS game involving tapping on cats that pop out of holes in the ground, but only when the color of the cat matches the color of the big cat at the top of the screen.

The idea for this project was created at a hackathon in 2017. After multiple refinements, the game was submitted to the app store in March 2018. The game was created with Swift and Xcode, and Piskel was used for art design.

As the player progresses, the frequency of cat appearances will increase, as well as the frequency that the big cat changes color.
